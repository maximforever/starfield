                Fortunately, you'll have some help from floating space debris along the way. Some power-ups are applied instantly (<span class = "bold">extra bullets</span> and <span class = "bold">HP</span>), but others (<span class = "bold">hyperspeed</span> and <span class = "bold">berserk</span>) are stored for whenever you're ready to use them.
